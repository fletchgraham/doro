# Doro

A focused task timer for working through your day.

## Philosophy

Doro is like a doctor's notepad—start fresh each morning, throw it away at the end of the day. It's not meant for persistent task storage or long-term project management. It's a tool for deciding, moment by moment, what to work on right now.

## Features

- Pomodoro-style countdown timer
- Drag-and-drop task organization
- Task status workflow: Ready → Working → Active → Done
- Time tracking per task
- Estimate vs. actual duration tracking
- Quick task entry with keyboard shortcuts
- Export tasks to clipboard

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `a` - Open add task modal
- `s` - Open switch task modal
- `↑/↓` - Reorder selected task
- `Cmd+V` (when paused) - Bulk add tasks from clipboard (one per line)
